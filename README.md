# polecen

Polecen is a command arguments parser for [Serenity][serenity].  

## Current state

Polecen is currently in very early stages. Almost everything is subject to a refactor and/or breaking changes relatively soon.  

## Macros example

You can declare a command using the powerful expand macro:

```rust
use serenity::model::guild::Member;

polecen::expand_command_here!((TestCommandArgs) test => match {
    kick => {
        target#Member "Target member";
        reason#String [*] "Reason"; // optional argument
    },
    version | ver | "?" => {}
});
```

Once a command has been declared, you can read the arguments using `read_args`:

```rust
// args is a &str iterable
// ctx is a serenity context
let args = polecen::read_args!(TestCommandArgs, args, ctx, [M] message)?; // âž¾ TestCommandArgs
```

And later get values from the args' fields:

```rust
match &args {
    TestCommandArgs::Kick(args) => {
        // target is of type Member
        // reason is of type String
        let TestCommandArgsKick { target, reason } = args;

        /* do something with target and reason */
    },
    TestCommandArgs::Version(_) => {
        /* do something */
    },
}
```

Please check the [examples](./examples) directory for more examples.

### Generated code

The example above would generate 3 structures:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub enum TestCommandArgs {
    Kick(TestCommandArgsKick),
    Version(TestCommandArgsVersion),
}

impl serenity::prelude::CommandArguments for TestCommandArgs {
    /* implementation of read_arguments */
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct TestCommandArgsKick {
    pub target: Member,
    pub reason: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct TestCommandArgsVersion {
}
```

Upcoming improvements will most likely include not generating empty structures and using struct-like enums whenever possible.

## Argument list parser

Polecen provides an argument list parser to capture quoted arguments.  
> This parser is currently powered by fancy-regex, but is intended to be rewritten in rust for performance and to know where parsing failed.

Example usage:

```rust
let mut args = split_args(&s);
```

Example input:

* `these are some arguments` => ["these", "are", "some", "arguments"]
* `these are some "quoted arguments"` => ["these", "are", "some", "quoted arguments"]
* `"of course, \"escaping\" works fine"` => ["of course, \"escaping\" works fine"]
